<h1>PromoEmail</h1>

It is an email sending project by which you can send your customized HTML based Resume email.

The main idea is to send an HTML based Resume/CV to the employer and any other person. Because most of the job seekers are sending plain text based email for and attached their Resume/CV on it. Therefore we just created a project to send an HTML based Resume/CV. 

Please change your desired SMTP settings in web.config file for your email, password, smtp client and port number.

Also there are two html files i.e. "Resume.htm" & "Reply.htm". These files contains the content of the git owner (that's me) therefore you can change the content of these file, I mean the data and write your details accordingly.
